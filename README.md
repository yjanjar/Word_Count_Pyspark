# Word_Count_Pyspark
The goal of this project is to count the words of a given dataset using Google Colab, i.e Implementing a PySpark program that counts the number of occurrences of each word in the given file.


# Running the Code
The Given notebook has been designed to run on Google Colab (free tier), all the setup installation are contained within the notebook. All a user has to do is to upload the notebook to colab start a session, upload the file to be used for the word count, fill out the path to the file in the according cell then simply run all the cell the notebook contains and a file results.txt will be produced with the results of the word count that can be downloaded loacally from the colab session. Enjoy :)
